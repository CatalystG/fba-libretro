==============================================================================
			CELLFRAMEWORK Mk. II
==============================================================================
A framework with the following goals:

* Provide an easy and clean framework for porting over applications to PS3.
* Fully functional video/audio/input drivers written in C that can be 
  implemented by the porter.
* File system browser.
* Logger interface (Netlogger only so far), great for debugging. 

==============================================================================
			Applications using it
==============================================================================
Some of the applications that have been built using Cellframework as a base 
include:

* SNES9x PS3 (Super Famicom/Super Nintendo Entertainment System emulator)
* FCEU PS3 (Nintendo Famicom/Nintendo Entertainment System emulator)
* VBA PS3 (Game Boy Advance emulator)
* Genesis Plus GX PS3 (Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis emulator)
* VICE PS3 (Commodore 64 emulator)
* FBANext PS3 (Arcade game emulator) 

Most of these apps still use Mk. I, and will be updated shortly to use 
version Mk. II.
